/// file sits under `mpus_in_progress/`. This is the *decision*, made once at the
/// moment a range is created, and its result is recorded in [`RangeSpec::staged`].
/// Reading an *existing* range's tier is a different operation — use
/// [`is_staged_range_spec`], which consults the recorded value and only falls back
/// to this function when there is none.
///
/// # Renamed from `is_staged_range` (2026-08-27, R12.4)
///
/// The old name and signature — `classify_new_range_as_staged(range_file_path, is_write_cached)` —
/// read as a per-range predicate and was not one. Its only per-range input is the
/// path arm below, which cannot fire for a freshly-built `RangeSpec` (see the next
/// section), so for all live data it reduced to a single object-level bool while
/// every credit and debit was applied per range. Every reader of it therefore
/// classified a flagged object's read-tier ranges as staged although nothing had
/// credited them, and graduation debited more than it credited. Requirements.md R12
/// has the full mechanism and both error directions.
///
/// The function survived the fix because deciding a *new* range's tier genuinely is
/// this expression; what was retired is its use as a *reader*. The name now says
/// which of the two it is, so a future reader cannot reach for it by accident, and
/// `is_staged_range_spec` calls it for the unrecorded case so the union rule still
/// has exactly one definition.
///
/// # Why the union, when the path arm looks dead
///
/// Traced 2026-08-25: every `RangeSpec` built by a live write path derives
/// `file_path` from `strip_prefix(cache_dir/ranges)`, which returns `Err` (and is
/// propagated) for anything outside `ranges/`. The four producers are
/// `DiskCacheManager::store_range`, `DiskCacheManager::finalize_incremental_range`,
/// `CacheManager::store_full_object_as_range_new`, and the multipart-completion
/// finalizer in `signed_put_handler` — and that last one *renames* each part out
/// of `mpus_in_progress/` into `ranges/` **before** building its `RangeSpec`.
/// Multipart parts are finalized by `finalize_incremental_part`, which
/// deliberately builds no `RangeSpec` at all while the part is still staged.
///
/// So the path arm cannot fire for a freshly-constructed range. It is retained
/// because a `RangeSpec` is also **deserialised from a persisted `.meta`**, which
/// carries whatever string was written to disk by whatever version wrote it. That
/// is the reachable case, and it is the one the path-only unit test covers — and
/// since R12 that case is reached exclusively through the `None` fallback of
/// [`is_staged_range_spec`], because any range this function classifies is recorded
/// immediately and never re-derived.
///
/// This corrects the spec's original framing, which described the predicate
/// disagreement as an active "opposite-direction leak" driving `write_cache_size`
/// toward undershoot. On the current tree it is not reachable from a live write —
/// unifying the predicate is consistency hardening plus legacy-data tolerance, not
/// the repair of a running leak. The repair of the running leak is R5/R6.
