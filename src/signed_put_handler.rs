//! Signed PUT and Multipart Upload Handler
//!
//! Handles AWS SigV4 signed write requests: single-part PUT plus the four
//! multipart upload operations. Every request is forwarded to S3 unmodified
//! (the proxy holds no credentials and cannot re-sign) and cached in parallel.
//!
//! Handler routing (from `handle_signed_put`):
//!
//! | Request                                   | Handler                               |
//! | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
//! | `PUT /key` (non-multipart)                | [`SignedPutHandler::handle_with_caching`] |
//! | `POST /key?uploads`                       | [`SignedPutHandler::handle_create_multipart_upload`] |
//! | `PUT  /key?uploadId=X&partNumber=N`       | [`SignedPutHandler::handle_upload_part`] |
//! | `POST /key?uploadId=X` (no partNumber)    | [`SignedPutHandler::handle_complete_multipart_upload`] |
//! | `DELETE /key?uploadId=X`                  | [`SignedPutHandler::handle_abort_multipart_upload`] |
//!
//! # Multipart upload invariants
//!
//! For the multipart code paths in particular, see
//! [`docs/MULTIPART_UPLOAD.md`](../../../docs/MULTIPART_UPLOAD.md) for the
//! state machine, correctness gates, concurrency semantics, and threat model.
//! Short version:
//!
//! - In-flight state lives under `{cache_dir}/mpus_in_progress/{uploadId}/`. A
//!   part owns its own `part{N}.bin`, `part{N}.json` and `part{N}.lock`; there is
//!   no shared tracker document that each part appends to.
//! - The streaming part path (`open_multipart_part_sink` + its `finalize`) must
//!   hold `part{N}.lock` across both the part-file rename and the part-record
//!   write — same-part-number concurrent writes rely on this. Per part, not per
//!   upload: see [`SignedPutHandler::record_part_blocking`].
//! - `finalize_multipart_upload` first waits (bounded by
//!   [`MULTIPART_COMPLETE_CACHE_WAIT`]) for the records of the parts its own
//!   request body names, then only retains the cache if S3 succeeded, the request
//!   body parses, every requested part is cached locally, every requested ETag
//!   matches its record, and the assembled part count agrees with S3's ETag. Any
//!   miss → no cache entry; whether staging is also deleted depends on the path
//!   (see [`SignedPutHandler::cleanup_incomplete_multipart_cache`]).
//! - `aws_chunked_decoder` is the one true chunk parser for both this handler
//!   and the non-multipart PUT path.

/// How long `CompleteMultipartUpload` will wait for the part records it needs to

///
/// The per-part cache task is fire-and-forget and lags the client's response by
/// design, so on a working cache this wait is the normal path rather than an
/// exception — measured stragglers landed within about three seconds of Complete.
/// Ten seconds leaves room for a slow shared volume without letting a genuinely
/// lost part hold a client-visible request open indefinitely.
///
/// It is worth being explicit that this trades Complete latency for a working
/// cache. Complete previously returned as soon as S3 did; it now may wait for
/// local work. The cost is bounded, only paid on multipart uploads, and the
/// alternative measured outcome was multipart objects never being cached at all.
///
/// Deliberately a fixed internal constant rather than a config field: no operator
/// has needed to tune it, and the shape of the fix does not depend on the value.
/// If a need appears, a field with this as its default is a compatible change.

/// How many part-cache finalizations may hold a `spawn_blocking` thread at
/// once, per process.
///
/// # Why this bound exists, and why the rationale changed
///
/// This started as a fix for a real, measured failure: before per-part records
/// (see [`Self::record_part_blocking`]), every part's finalize took an exclusive
/// cross-instance `flock` on a single shared `upload.lock` and rewrote the WHOLE
/// `upload.meta` tracker, so per-part cost grew with the number of parts already
/// recorded and every in-flight part queued on that one lock. Each waiter occupied
/// a `spawn_blocking` thread for up to its 30-second timeout; the forward path
/// needs that same pool, so the pool was exhausted and the client's upload failed.
/// Measured on a three-proxy fleet at 2,000 parts (2026-08-21, release 2.6.0,
/// against the shared-`upload.lock` design): **1,214 `upload.lock` timeouts and
/// 1,220 part-record failures across the three instances, and the client's upload
/// failed** with `Connection reset by peer` on an `UploadPart`.
///
/// **That mechanism no longer exists.** Finalization now takes a *per-part*
/// `part{N}.lock` (see [`Self::finalize_and_record_cached_part`]), so two writers
/// on different part numbers never contend at all — only same-part-number retries
/// do, which is the correctness gate this was always meant to preserve, not the
/// throughput problem. Re-run at 2,000 parts against the per-part-lock design
/// showed zero lock contention from this cause.
///
/// This semaphore is kept anyway, as a **plain backstop** rather than a fix for a
/// live defect: it caps how many finalizations can occupy a `spawn_blocking`
/// thread simultaneously, independent of why any one of them might be slow (a
/// degraded shared volume, an unusually large part, etc.). It is not load-bearing
/// for the 2,000-part case any more: re-measured against the per-part-lock
/// design, that case succeeds without this semaphore needing to intervene.
///
/// Four is deliberately below the AWS CLI's default upload concurrency of 10, so
/// the queue is bounded for the common client, while leaving enough parallelism
/// that a single slow shared-volume operation does not serialise everything behind
/// it. It does **not** reduce the total serialised time for one upload — see the
/// note on `MULTIPART_COMPLETE_CACHE_WAIT` and the deferred O(n²) work.
