//! Journal Consolidator Module
//!
//! Provides background consolidation of journal entries into metadata files for the atomic
//! metadata writes system. Handles configurable intervals, threshold-based triggers, conflict
//! resolution, and range file existence validation.
//!
//! Also provides size tracking for the cache - the consolidator is the single source of truth
//! for cache size, calculating size deltas from journal entries during consolidation.
