//! Failing-first regressions for `.kiro/specs/expired-entry-revalidation/`.
//!
//! Spec: Requirements 2, 3, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3. GitHub issue #17.
//!
//! # The defect, named at the line
//!
//! `DiskCacheManager::find_cached_ranges` returns `Ok(Vec::new())` when
//! `SystemTime::now() > metadata.expires_at`. That empty vector becomes
//! `cached_ranges: []` / `can_serve_from_cache: false` in
//! `RangeHandler::find_cached_ranges`, which fails the
//! `!overlap.cached_ranges.is_empty()` guard in **both** mainline handlers — and
//! `check_object_expiration`, the `ttl_revalidations_total` metric, the validator
//! injection, the `304` handling and the cached serve all sit *inside* that
//! guard.
//!
//! So once stored expiry passes, the cached metadata, the ETag and the bytes are
//! all still on disk and none of them are considered. The request degrades to a
//! full transfer plus a cache rewrite. With `get_ttl: 0` that is *every*
//! sequential re-read.
//!
//! # What these tests assert, and why it is not the response body
//!
//! A test that only checked the returned bytes would pass today: the miss path
//! fetches from S3 and returns correct data. The observable that distinguishes
//! the defect from the fix is **whether a conditional request was issued at
//! all**, so every test here asserts on the captured upstream request:
//!
//! - a conditional exists (R7.1);
//! - it carries the cached validator (R2.1);
//! - on the range path it carries the client's **raw** `Range`, on the **same**
//!   request as the validator (R3.2, R3.3);
//! - the response was served from cache rather than from a body transfer (R2.2).
//!
//! Per `pre-push-checklist.md` § "Assert the predicate the code evaluates", the
//! stub returns `304` **only** for the expected validator. A `304` requires the
//! proxy to have sent the right ETag, so the served-from-cache assertion cannot
//! be satisfied by a request that guessed.
//!
//! # Range first
//!
//! The range cases lead because that is the customer-blocking half: a sequential
//! ranged reader re-fetches the whole object body from S3 on every pass while its
//! bytes sit unread on disk.
